  * DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0
  
  * R/gamcox.R, R/print.gamcox.R, R/predict.gamcox.R: MAPGAM now includes functions
  to fit a Cox additive model for survival data by calling gamcox or specifying 
  family = "survival" in modgam. The model returned a object of class "gamcox", 
  which can be expressed by print and predict.
  
  * R/modgam.R: modgam now can fit both GAM and GAMCOX models. Added an option 
  "survival" for argument "family". Added "formula" argument(optional), which 
  allow for specifying the model using formula expression. Added "se.fit" argument
  to specify whether to compute pointwise standard errors and confidence intervals.
  Set a class for the returned object, "modgam".  The returned object has some
  differences from previous versions of MapGAM, such as "exp" instead of "OR" for
  exponentiated fit values.  
  
  * R/mypredict.gam.R: Can be used to compute pointwise standard errors for new 
  predictions based on a gam object which the predict.gam function in gam package 
  can not do. 
  
  * R/optspan.R: Added "spans" argument so that the candidate spans can be specified
  flexibly.

  * R/colormap.R: Added an option "interval" for argument "contours" to plot countours
  to specify areas where confidence intervals exclude zero. Added "contours.drawlables",
  "contours.lwd", "contours.lty", "contours.levels", "contours.labcex" to make plotting
   contour lines more flexibly. Added "legend.name", "legend.cex" and "legend.add.line"
   to improve appearance.
  
  * R/plot.modgam.R, R/print.modgam.R: print and plot functions for object returned
  by modgam. For plot, optionally, if the object containes confidence intervals, 
  colormap of confidence intervals can be generated.
  
  * data/CAdata.rda, data/CAgrid.rda, data/CAmap.rda: Added three data set for examples
  of analysing spatial effects on survival rates.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.7-5

	* R/colormap.R: added "axes" argument, which improves appearance and readability
	of chemical mixture interaction plots when set to TRUE.    

	* R/trimdata.R: changed CRS function call to conform to new error checks in the
	sp package.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.7-4

	* R/colormap.R: changed to improve scale size and appearance, and position 
	of legend.  Added "contours" argument for contours based on either permutation
	test p-values or predicted response.  Also fixed error in example code.

	* NAMESPACE: added import and importFrom commands to conform to new CRAN policy.    

	* R/sampcont.R, R/trimdata.R: added PBSmapping:: to functions called from 
	that package, and updated documentation to clarify which options require
	PBSmapping.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.7-0

	* R/modgam.R, R/optspan.R, R/colormap.R: MapGAM now includes an
	unconditional permutation test, and allows the user to select 
	any family and link function.  The package was previously limited 
	to the (now default) binomial family with a logit link, but potential 
	applications are broader such as investigation of joint effects of chemical 
	mixtures (suggested by Tom Webster, Boston University).  The relevant 
	help files are updated to reflect these changes, and new examples have 
	been added to the modgam help file.   

	* data/MAdata.rda: Added two new columns to the simulated data set, 
	for use in a new chemical mixtures example.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.6-2

	* DESCRIPTION (Depends/Suggests): PBSmapping changed from Depends
	to Suggests, for compatibility with new PBSmapping license.

	* man/trimdata.Rd, man/predgrid.Rd, man/MapGAM-package.Rd, 
	man/colormap.Rd, man/sampcont.Rd: only test certain examples if 
	PBSmapping is installed, and note when non-tested examples require
 	PBSmapping.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.6-1

	* R/modgam.R (modgam): corrected error in p-value calculation for 
	global permutation test for significance of location.  Thanks to 
	Lucheng Shao, UC Irvine, for noting strange simulation results.
