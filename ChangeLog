  * DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.2-5

  * R/mypredict.gam.R:  Fixed error in mypredict.gam function associated with change in
  default argument in vcov function since R 3.5.0.  

  * R/modgam.R and R/plot.modgam:  Added "pointwise" argument with default value FALSE, to 
  skip pointwise permutation tests unless requested by the user.  Identification of high  
  risk regions is better accomplished using se.fit=TRUE, available since version 1.0. 
  Plot function warning message updated to reflect new argument.

  * DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.2-4

  * R/plot.modgam.R:  Fixed error in plot.modgam function associated with new "anchor"
  argument, now implemented in both plot.modgam and colormap. 
   
  * R/gamcox.fit.R:  Truncated step sizes (deltaeta) at -3 and 3 in order to avoid 
  potential problems. Also added warning message when final model deviance is higher 
  than deviance for a model using the same linear predictors and no smooth, and error
  check for infinite values in eta.      

  * R/optspan and R/gamcox:  Fixed same error in both functions--had sometimes 
  failed to identify the variables in the two-dimesional smooth, occasionally
  resulting in fatal error messages. 

  * R/gamcox:  replaced identical with all.equal to avoid spurious warning/error 
  when comparing two real values (span and spanf).

  * DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.2

  * R/colormap.R:  fixed error with double printing of y axis label when axes=TRUE,
  and added a new argument "anchor", with a default of anchor=F (the original method).  
  Anchoring the color scale bar to the referent value is now only performed when 
  legend.add.line is specified and anchor=T.

  * DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.1

  * R/summary.modgam.R: changed class check from "gam" to "Gam" to accomodate class
  name change from the gam library (starting with gam version 1.15).  

  * R/mypredict.gam.R: corrected error in dispersion parameter estimation for 
  quasibinomial and quasipoisson families.  Special thanks to Fabian Camacho,
  University of Virginia, for noticing the problem.   
  
  * R/colormap.R, R/plot.modgam.R: several modifications: new arugment allows
  users to specify any color palette, default palette for plot.modgam is changed to
  a divergent palette, new colormap help file example compares palettes, the color
  palette is now anchored on legend.add.line (if legend.add.line is specified),
  the color gradient now changes on an exponential (instead of linear) scale when 
  exp=T, help file now suggests readOGR instead of readShapePoly for importing 
  shapefiles, and formatting changed in the legend.     
  
  * added more S3 methods (coef(), formula(), summary(), AIC(), residuals())

  * copyright license information (GPL-3) added to all R code files

  * other minor changes and bug fixes

  * DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0
  
  * R/gamcox.R, R/print.gamcox.R, R/predict.gamcox.R: MAPGAM now includes functions
  to fit a Cox additive model for survival data by calling gamcox or specifying 
  family = "survival" in modgam. The model returned a object of class "gamcox", 
  which can be expressed by print and predict.
  
  * R/modgam.R: modgam now can fit both GAM and GAMCOX models. Added an option 
  "survival" for argument "family". Added "formula" argument(optional), which 
  allow for specifying the model using formula expression. Added "se.fit" argument
  to specify whether to compute pointwise standard errors and confidence intervals.
  Set a class for the returned object, "modgam".  The returned object has some
  differences from previous versions of MapGAM, such as "exp" instead of "OR" for
  exponentiated fit values.  
  
  * R/mypredict.gam.R: Can be used to compute pointwise standard errors for new 
  predictions based on a gam object which the predict.gam function in gam package 
  can not do. 
  
  * R/optspan.R: Added "spans" argument so that the candidate spans can be specified
  flexibly.

  * R/colormap.R: Added an option "interval" for argument "contours" to plot countours
  to specify areas where confidence intervals exclude zero. Added "contours.drawlables",
  "contours.lwd", "contours.lty", "contours.levels", "contours.labcex" to make plotting
   contour lines more flexibly. Added "legend.name", "legend.cex" and "legend.add.line"
   to improve appearance.
  
  * R/plot.modgam.R, R/print.modgam.R: print and plot functions for object returned
  by modgam. For plot, optionally, if the object containes confidence intervals, 
  colormap of confidence intervals can be generated.
  
  * data/CAdata.rda, data/CAgrid.rda, data/CAmap.rda: Added three data set for examples
  of analysing spatial effects on survival rates.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.7-5

	* R/colormap.R: added "axes" argument, which improves appearance and readability
	of chemical mixture interaction plots when set to TRUE.    

	* R/trimdata.R: changed CRS function call to conform to new error checks in the
	sp package.   

2014-12-10  Scott Bartell <sbartell@uci.edu>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.7-4

	* R/colormap.R: changed to improve scale size and appearance, and position 
	of legend.  Added "contours" argument for contours based on either permutation
	test p-values or predicted response.  Also fixed error in example code.

	* NAMESPACE: added import and importFrom commands to conform to new CRAN policy.    

	* R/sampcont.R, R/trimdata.R: added PBSmapping:: to functions called from 
	that package, and updated documentation to clarify which options require
	PBSmapping.  

2013-12-12  Scott Bartell <sbartell@uci.edu>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.7-0

	* R/modgam.R, R/optspan.R, R/colormap.R: MapGAM now includes an
	unconditional permutation test, and allows the user to select 
	any family and link function.  The package was previously limited 
	to the (now default) binomial family with a logit link, but potential 
	applications are broader such as investigation of joint effects of chemical 
	mixtures (suggested by Tom Webster, Boston University).  The relevant 
	help files are updated to reflect these changes, and new examples have 
	been added to the modgam help file.   

	* data/MAdata.rda: Added two new columns to the simulated data set, 
	for use in a new chemical mixtures example.   

2013-03-11  Scott Bartell <sbartell@uci.edu>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.6-2

	* DESCRIPTION (Depends/Suggests): PBSmapping changed from Depends
	to Suggests, for compatibility with new PBSmapping license.

	* man/trimdata.Rd, man/predgrid.Rd, man/MapGAM-package.Rd, 
	man/colormap.Rd, man/sampcont.Rd: only test certain examples if 
	PBSmapping is installed, and note when non-tested examples require
 	PBSmapping. 

2012-12-23  Scott Bartell <sbartell@uci.edu>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.6-1

	* R/modgam.R (modgam): corrected error in p-value calculation for 
	global permutation test for significance of location.  Thanks to 
	Lucheng Shao, UC Irvine, for noting strange simulation results.
